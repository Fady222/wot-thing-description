# WoT Thing Description (TD) Explainer

## What role does TD specification play in WoT?



The Thing Description (TD) specification is attempting to address the interoperability between Things (and applications that use Things) in how Things manifest their *Interaction Affordance* (i.e. properties, actions and events) to clients, using Web technologies such as Hypermedia controls (links, forms, etc.) and Media Types.  

With TD, the clients are informed of the choice to make in interacting with the Things, and drive an application just as Web pages let users to make choices in navigating the Web and drive Web applications through links and forms.

How to Interact with Things / Services

Below shows a figure borrowed from WoT Architecture document, showing the WoT building blocks. Each building block is concerned with addressing one of the four aspects of interoperability issues identified in the scope of the WoT WG's work for the current charter.
