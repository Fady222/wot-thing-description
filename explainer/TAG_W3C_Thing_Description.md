Góðan dag TAG！

I'm requesting a TAG review of:

  - Name: Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description
  - Specification URL: tbd for the freezed version for TAG review
  - Explainer, Requirements Doc, or Example code:  https://github.com/w3c/wot-thing-description/blob/master/explainer/Explainer.md
  - Tests: https://w3c.github.io/wot-thing-description/testing/report.html
  - Primary contacts: @sebastiankb, @takuki, @mmccool, @vcharpenay

Further details (optional):

  - Relevant time constraints or deadlines: if possible end of March
  - [x] I have read and filled out the [Self-Review Questionnare on Security and Privacy](https://www.w3.org/TR/security-privacy-questionnaire/). The [assessment is here](url). 
  - [X] I have reviewed the TAG's [API Design Principles](https://w3ctag.github.io/design-principles/)

You should also know that...

In the Thing Description specification, text and table entries highlighted with a yellow background indicates a feature associated with an at-risk assertion for which insufficient implementation experience exists. When an entire section is at-risk the words "This section is at risk." will be placed at the start of the section and highlighted with a yellow background.

In the meantime of the TAG review, we are continue and update the test results to reduce the number of at-risk assertions before CR submit. 

We'd prefer the TAG provide feedback as (please select one):

  - [x] open issues in our Github repo for each point of feedback
  - [ ] open a single issue in our Github repo for the entire review
  - [ ] leave review feedback as a comment in this issue and @-notify [github usernames]

_Please preview the issue and check that the links work before submitting_
