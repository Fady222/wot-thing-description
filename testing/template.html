<h2 id="h_intro"><a id="intro" name="intro">1. Introduction</a> </h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wot/td">Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description Specification</a>
   entered the Candidate Recommendation period on XX February 2019.</p>

<p> The planned date for entering Proposed Recommendation is XX March 2019.
This document
summarizes the results from the Web of Things (WoT) TD implementation reports received and
describes the process that the Web of Things (WoT) Working Group followed in preparing the report.</p>

<h4 id="h_objectives"><a id="objectives" name="objectives">1.1 Implementation report objectives</a></h4>
<ol>
	<li>Must verify that the specification is implementable.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="h_non_objectives"><a id="non_objectives" name="non_objectives">1.2 Implementation report non-objectives</a></h4>
<ol>
	<li>The IR does not attempt conformance testing of implementations.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="h_cr_work"><a id="cr_work" name="cr_work">2. Work during the Candidate Recommendation period</a></h2>
<p>During the CR period, the Working Group carried out the following activities:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Clarification and improvement of the exposition of the specification<br/></li>
	<li>Disposing of comments that were communicated to the WG during the CR period. 
        These comments and their resolution are detailed in the 
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2019/PR-xxx/disp.html">Disposition of Comments</a> 
          document for the CR period.</li>
	<li>Preparation of this Implementation Report.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="h_participate"><a id="participate" name="participate">3. Participating in the implementation report</a></h2>
<p>Implementors were invited to contribute to the assessment of the W3C Web of Things (WoT)
Thing Description Specification by submitting  implementation reports describing the 
coverage of their implementations with respect to the test assertions outlined 
in the <a href="#test_assertions" shape="rect">table below</a>.</p>
<p>Implementation reports, comments on this document, or requests made for
further information were  posted to the Working Group's public
mailing list <a href="mailto:wot-wg@w3.org">wot-wg@w3.org</a>
(<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-wot/">archive</a>)
and as issues on the github repository i

4. Entrance criteria for the Proposed Recommendation phase</a></h2>
<p>The Web of Things (WoT) Working Group established the following
entrance criteria for the Proposed Recommendation phase in the
Request for CR:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sufficient reports of implementation experience have been
gathered to demonstrate that Things can be described by Thing Descriptions 
in sufficient detail to allow interoperabilty.</li>
<li>Specific Implementation Report Requirements (<a href="#report_reqs">outlined below</a>) have been met.</li>
<li>The Working Group has formally addressed and responded to all 
    public comments received by the Working Group.</li>
</ol>
<p>All three of these criteria have been met. 
<!-- Hard to count since some implementations have multiple components, and some are shared.  Omit.
A total of N implementations were documented by M different organizations.
-->
The testimonials below indicate the broad base of support 
for the specification. All of the required features had at least
two implementations. 
All of the optional features received at least two implementations.
However, these optional features do not have 
conformance requirements that have an impact on interoperability. </p>

<h4 id="h_DetailedReqs">
<a id="DetailedReqs" shape="rect" name="DetailedReqs">5.1 Detailed requirements for implementation report</a></h4>
<ol>
	<li>Testimonials from implementers are included in the IR when
provided to document the utility and implementability of the
specification.</li>
	<li>IR must cover all specified features in the specification. For
each feature the IR should indicate:
    <ul>
	     <li>Feature status: required, optional, other.</li>
	     <li>Feature utility/usefulness based on feedback from
implementers.</li>
	     <li>Implementability of the feature specification.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Feature status is a factor in test coverage in the report:
    <ul>
		<li>Required specification features must have at least two
implementations. Implementations that do not implement a required
specification feature must document the reason for not implementing
the feature.</li>
		<li>Optional specification features must have at least one
implementation. Implementations that do not implement an optional specification
feature should document the reason for not implementing the
feature. </li>

<a id="systems" name="systems">6. Systems</a></h2>
<p>This section contains descriptions of each of the implementations
of the WoT Thing Description specification
from all organizations that submitted implementation reports.
Each implementation represents a working system 
that either exposes or consumes at least one WoT Thing Description.
Implementations that expose a Thing Description act as a network
server with an interface as described in the Thing Description it exposes. 
Implementations that consume a Thing Description act as a network
client and issue network requests consistent with the target Thing Description.
In some cases a given implementation may be used for multiple Things
and a single Thing may also act as both client and server on
multiple interfaces.
</p><p>
We only count systems with mostly independent code bases 
as distinct implementations.
There are however some cases (documented in the following) where 
implementations shared components but were still considered substantially
independent implementations.  In cases where a substantial component
was shared across implementations the features supported by that 
component were only counted once.
</p>
<div class="working">

<h3 id="impl-intel">Intel K.K. (Japan)</h3>   
<p>Intel supports this specification as it enables interoperation between devices
from different manufacturers, supporting the growth of an ecosystem of interoperating
IoT services and easing barriers to adoption.
</p>
<p>Three separate implementations were developed, all based on Node.js.
The core implementations focused on basic local network access without built-in security.
A separate project (used by all three implementations) provided security by means of a reverse proxy. 
For the purposes of validation this reverse proxy was considered a shared component of all three implementations, 
and the features it implemented were only counted once in the results.
</p>
<h4 id="impl-intel-security">Security and Authentication Proxy: Shared Component</h4>
This component, shared across all implementations provided by Intel, was a reverse proxy service that provided
authentication (via various mechanisms indicated by the schemes indicated in the Thing
Description) and encrypted transport termination.
The reverse proxy service was made accessible over a secure tunnel, and depending on the circumstances,
was run in the cloud, on a gateway computer, or locally on a device.
As this component implemented the security features in all other implementations
from Intel, for the purposes of validation
these features are only recorded as being supported in a single implementation.
</p>
<h4 id="impl-intel-ocf">OCF Metadata Bridge: TD Producer</h4>
<p>This implementation translated metadata made available by devices implemented using
the OCF standard and re-expressed that metadata in the form of WoT Thing Descriptions.
The actual network interfaces were however provided either by the OCF devices themselves
directly via CoAP, or via a CoAP/HTTP bridge developed by OCF.  The metadata
translator also had the ability to add semantic markup to the generated WoT Thing Descriptions,
using a database that related OCF Resource Types to iotschema.org capabilities.
Secure interfaces (eg HTTPS combined with an authentication scheme) were provided
via a reverse proxy attached to the HTTP interface provided by the bridge.
</p>
<h4 id="impl-intel-speak">WebSpeak: TD Producer</h4>
<p>This implementation provided a service to convert text to speech.  English
text set to its network interface was spoken audibily.  This service was used to
test several accessibility scenarios, including automatic conversion of visible status
and event information to spoken announcements in order to support blind users.
This implementation only supported an HTTP network interface, without security.
Secure interfaces (eg HTTPS combined with an authentication scheme) were provided
via a reverse proxy attached to the HTTP interface.
The TDs for this service were produced using a template mechanism.
</p>
<h4 id="intel-camera">Simple Web Camera: TD Producer</h4>
<p>This implementation provided a service to capture still images from a camera
and provide them over its network interface.  This was used to test various aspects
of actions, including support for inputs and outputs with different content types.
The service was also capaple of introspecting the parameters made available via any
particular attached video4linux camera
and made those parameters available as WoT Thing Description properties.
This implementation only supported an HTTP network interface, without security.
Secure interfaces (eg HTTPS combined with an authentication scheme) were provided
via a reverse proxy attached to the HTTP interface.
The TDs for this service were produced using a template mechanism.
</p>

<h3 id="impl-siemens">Siemens AG</h3>   
<p>
Siemens supports this specification as it allows to attach metadata to heterogeneous IoT devices and services in a uniform way.
The extensible model with a standardized serialization format in particular remedies interoperability challenges with an installed base of long-lived industrial devices.
Furthermore, this specification is a central building block for several digitalization topics such as device onboarding, device management, digital twins, and data analytics.
</p>
<p>
Siemens commits to several open-source implementations of W3C Web of Things, which are managed in the public Eclipse Thingweb project.
Siemens also implemented concepts of this specification in products and aims at aligning the implementations and opening the features to customers once this specification reaches REC status.
</p>
<h4 id="impl-siemens-node-wot">node-wot: TD Consumer and Producer</h4>
<p>
node-wot is a Node.js-based framework for WoT Servients.
It features an implementation of the WoT Scripting API to both consume TDs to instantiate Consumed Things and produce Exposed Things that provide a TD.
node-wot supports several Protocol Bindings including HTTP, CoAP, WebSockets, and MQTT with corresponding security mechanisms such as (D)TLS, HTTP Basic, Digest, Bearer Token, PSK, and username/password, respectively.
</p>
<h4 id="impl-siemens-thingweb-directory">Thingweb Directory: TD Consumer and Producer</h4>
<p>
Thingweb Directory provides a directory service written in Java to register TDs and look them up through queries (primarily SPARQL).
The implementation is consuming TDs to represent their metadata in a KnowledgeGraph and (re-)procudes TDs to return look-up results.
Currently it supports HTTP and CoAP bindings.
</p>
<h4 id="impl-siemens-wot-fxui">WoT-fxUI: TD Consumer</h4>
<p>
WoT-fxUI is a generic user interface (UI) for Things based on Java with JavaFX.
It consumes TDs to render UI elements that allow human users to interact with Things.
The implementation currently supports HTTP and CoAP bindings.

</a><h2 id="h_test_class"><a id="test-results-xml" name="test-results-xml"></a>
<a id="test_class" name="test_class">7. Test results</a></h2>
<p>The aim of this section is to describe the range of test assertions
developed for the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xxx">Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description Specification</a> 
and summarize the results from the implementation 
reports received in the CR period.
The table lists all the assertions that were derived
from the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xxx">Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description Specification</a>.
</p> 
<p>The <b>ID</b> column uniquely identifies the assertion.
and links to the assertion in the context of the specification.
The <b>Assertion</b> column gives the text of the assertion 
specifying the constraint which must be met.
The <b>Req</b> column is a Y/N value indicating whether the test assertion is for a feature which is required.
The <b>Sub</b> column is a Y/N value indicating whether the test assertion is a subconstraint which is dependent on the
implementation of the preceding non subconstraint feature test assertion.
The <b>Result</b> column is annotated with the number of 'pass' (P), 'fail' (F), and 'not implemented' (N)
status results in the individual implementation reports.
The T column indicates the total number of implementations (or implementation components in the case
of shared components) reporting a status on each assertion.
</p>
<h4 id="h_intro_class">
<a id="intro_class" name="intro_class">7.1 Classification of test assertions</a>
</h4>
<p>
 Test assertions are classified into two types,
 basic test assertions which test for the presence of each feature, and sub 
 constraints which only apply if that particular feature is implemented.
 Sub constraints are 
 marked with 'SUB CONSTRAINT:' in the 'Assertion' field and 'Y' in the Sub field.</p>
