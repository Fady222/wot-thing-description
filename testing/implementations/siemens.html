<p>
Siemens supports this specification as it allows to attach metadata to heterogeneous IoT devices and services in a uniform way.
The extensible model with a standardized serialization format in particular remedies interoperability challenges with an installed base of long-lived industrial devices.
Furthermore, this specification is a central building block for several digitalization topics such as device onboarding, device management, digital twins, and data analytics.
</p>
<p>
Siemens commits to several open-source implementations of W3C Web of Things, which are managed in the public Eclipse Thingweb project.
Siemens also implemented concepts of this specification in products and aims at aligning the implementations and opening the features to customers once this specification reaches REC status.

<h4 id="impl-siemens-node-wot">node-wot: TD Consumer and Producer</h4>
<p>
node-wot is a Node.js-based framework for WoT Servients.
It features an implementation of the WoT Scripting API to both consume TDs to instantiate Consumed Things and produce Exposed Things that provide a TD.
node-wot supports several Protocol Bindings including HTTP, CoAP, WebSockets, and MQTT with corresponding security mechanisms such as (D)TLS, HTTP Basic, Digest, Bearer Token, PSK, and username/password, respectively.

<h4 id="impl-siemens-thingweb-directory">Thingweb Directory: TD Consumer and Producer</h4>
<p>
Thingweb Directory provides a directory service written in Java to register TDs and look them up through queries (primarily SPARQL).
The implementation is consuming TDs to represent their metadata in a KnowledgeGraph and (re-)procudes TDs to return look-up results.
Currently it supports HTTP and CoAP bindings.
</p>
<h4 id="impl-siemens-wot-fxui">WoT-fxUI: TD Consumer</h4>
<p>
WoT-fxUI is a generic user interface (UI) for Things based on Java with JavaFX.
It consumes TDs to render UI elements that allow human users to interact with Things.
The implementation currently supports HTTP and CoAP bindings.
